- secondary edges when converting from AlpinoXML to TigerXML

- different link search (inference) for terminals and for non-terminals
  terminals: allow many-to-many links
  non-terminals: only 1:1 links

- add word alignment links to training data to learn terminal links

- word alignment = terminal links (trust them completely?

- special features for terminal alignment
  (lcsr, dice, suffix, prefix, ...

- cascaded: first align terminals and then align non-terminals?


- stanford parser: should I add dependency relations somehow when reading from
  penn treebank format?
- handle berkeley parser format

- SEARN - without reading through training corpus several times
  (too much hazzle?)

- word alignment
  + read sentences (with factors?) instead of trees (how general is my
  implementation already?)
  + features from my previous implementation (lcsr, dice etc ...)
  

- multi-threaded alignment? is it worth it?
  (--> simpler: run on cluster!)
